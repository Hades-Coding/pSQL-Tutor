All the SQL statements pushed in X-Mind file
So, no need to push script into each folder.

 - Basic PostGreSQL script: was already filled in folder 02.BasicScripts
 - Database Admin: Will be filled in folder 01.DBA if I havae time.
 - Advanced (pgplSQL, trigger, view, indexes, functions & window function): Will be filled in folder 03.AdvancedScripts if I havae time.

Thanks!
